Current, state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition systems still face difficulties in terms of interacting with non-native speakers with accents. The existing literature on the same approaches the problem by training classifiers to identify accents with various acoustic and prosodic features like pitch periods, sub-band energies and formant frequencies as input. In this project, we propose that familial membership of a language also affects accent classification by investigating L1 effects on L2 acquisition. We employ a Recurrent Neural Network trained on MFCCs from speech samples in the Speech Accent Archive to compare the accuracy of classification by the addition of language family as a feature.
